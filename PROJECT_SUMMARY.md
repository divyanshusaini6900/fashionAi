# FashionModelingAI Project Summary

## Overview
FashionModelingAI is an advanced AI-powered fashion modeling system that generates professional fashion product images and videos using state-of-the-art AI models. This system helps fashion businesses create high-quality product visualizations without the need for traditional photo shoots.

## Features Implemented
1. **AI Image Generation**: Transform basic product photos into professional model shots
2. **Excel Report Generation**: Automatic generation of detailed product reports
3. **Multi-View Support**: Process multiple angles (front, back, detail views)
4. **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing e-commerce platforms
5. **Customizable Outputs**: Control style, background, and model characteristics

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini for image, text, and video generation
- **Storage**: Local file system (with optional AWS S3 integration)
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Deployment**: Local development with Uvicorn

## API Endpoints

### GET /
Health check endpoint that returns the status of the API.

### POST /api/v1/generate
Main generation endpoint that accepts the following form fields:
- `frontside` (required): Front view image of the fashion item
- `text` (required): Text description or instructions
- `username` (required): Username for SKU ID generation
- `product` (required): Product name for SKU ID generation
- `generate_video` (optional): Boolean flag for video generation (default: false)
- `numberOfOutputs` (optional): Number of image outputs to generate (1-4, default: 1)
- `backside` (optional): Back side image of the fashion item
- `sideview` (optional): Side view image of the fashion item
- `detailview` (optional): Detailed view image of the fashion item

## Setup and Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. API keys for Google Gemini
3. Postman (for API testing)

### Installation Steps
1. Set up virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv fash_env
   fash_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Postman Collection
This project includes a ready-to-use Postman collection for testing the API:

1. **Import Files**: Import `postman/FashionModelingAI_Collection.json` and `postman/FashionModelingAI_Environment.json` into Postman
2. **Select Environment**: Choose "FashionModelingAI Local" from the environment dropdown
3. **Test Endpoints**: Use the "Health Check" and "Generate Fashion Content" requests

## Test Results
The API has been successfully tested and generates:
- Professional model images with various backgrounds
- Detailed Excel reports with product information
- Metadata about the generation process

Example output files:
- `output_image_url`: Primary generated image
- `image_variations`: Additional image variations with different backgrounds
- `excel_report_url`: Excel report with product details
