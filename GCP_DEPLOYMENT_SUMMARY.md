## Key Features Added

### 1. Google Cloud Storage Support
- Added GCS helper functions for file upload operations
- Updated file helpers to support GCS
- Added conditional imports to minimize dependencies

### 2. Flexible Storage Configuration
- Enhanced configuration system to support Google Cloud Storage
- Added fallback mechanisms to ensure the application works even without cloud storage
- Removed AWS S3 support to focus exclusively on GCP

### 3. Comprehensive Deployment Guide
- Detailed step-by-step instructions for GCP deployment
- Configuration instructions for Compute Engine
- Service account setup and security best practices
- Nginx and SSL configuration for GCP
- Cloud Storage integration guide

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Created test scripts to validate GCS integration
- Added environment validation script
- Updated existing documentation to reference GCP options

## Configuration Options

The application now supports two storage configurations:

1. **Local Storage** (default for development):
   ```env
   USE_LOCAL_STORAGE="true"
   ```

2. **Google Cloud Storage**:
   ```env
   USE_LOCAL_STORAGE="false"
   GCS_BUCKET_NAME="your-gcs-bucket"
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account-key.json"
   ```

## Deployment Architecture

The GCP deployment uses the following components:

1. **Compute Engine** - For running the application server
2. **Cloud Storage** - For storing generated files (optional)
3. **Nginx** - As a reverse proxy and static file server
4. **Systemd** - For service management
5. **Gunicorn** - As the production WSGI server

## Security Considerations

1. Service account keys are properly managed through environment variables
2. Storage buckets can be configured with appropriate access controls
3. All existing security features are maintained
4. Proper error handling and logging for cloud storage operations

## Testing

To test the GCS integration:

```bash
# Validate environment configuration
python validate_env.py

# Test GCS integration (if configured)
python test_gcs_integration.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Follow the detailed instructions in [GCP_DEPLOYMENT.md](file:///c%3A/Users/LENOVO/Desktop/fashion/FashionModelingAI-master/GCP_DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Set up your Google Cloud project and credentials
3. Configure the environment variables
4. Deploy the application to Compute Engine
5. Test the deployment with the provided test scripts
